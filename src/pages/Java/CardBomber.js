        This is the final project of my Grade 11 Computer Science course
        (ICS3U0). The purpose of this project is to create a game in Java with
        the HSA Console library that was used throughout the semester.
      </p>
      <p>
        This game was inspired by Voltorb Flip. The game functions like the Card
        Bomber App described <a href="#gamescreen">above</a>, except it is
        controlled using WASD keys for movements and the Enter key for
        selecting.
