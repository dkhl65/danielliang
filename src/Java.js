          My first encounter with Java is with Processing, which is an IDE based
          on Java for creating visuals. I formally learned learned Java in grade
          11 computer science class, using Dr. Java IDE. I used it for school
          projects. In the summer, I experimented with Android Studio, which
          uses Java and XML to make Android apps. Below are my most significant
          work created with Java.

        <h2 id="cardbomberapp">Card Bomber Android App (2018)</h2>
        <p>
          Android app developing with Android Studio is a personal project that
          I took on in the summer break. Android uses XML for the layout and
          Java for the program. This app is the mobile version of the Card
          Bomber game which I made in grade 11 (below). It has support for three
          languages.

          This is my grade 12 computer science final project that I worked on
          with one other student. A physics teacher was acting as our client and
          we produced software according to his demands. This software animates
          a projectile shot from a cannon with the velocity that the user
          enters. It can also solve for values (speed, angle, etc) to hit the
          target. It is the most complicated software that I have developed.

          This is the final project of my grade 11 computer science course. We
          had to design a game. This game is spin on Minesweeper. There is a
          grid of square cards, which can contain a number value or a bomb. Each
          row and column has a clue indicating the total of cards values and
          number of bombs. Hitting too many bombs will end the game.

          A simple program I made on Processing. The screen is initially black.
          By pressing R, G or B and dragging the mouse, a colourful gradient is
          drawn. Holding down R, G or B activates the large brush size. Holding
          E will erase what is drawn. Pressing S will save a screenshot in the
          same folder as the program.
