      <p>
        This is my grade 12 computer science final project that I worked on with
        one other student. A physics teacher was acting as our client and we
        produced software according to his demands. This software animates a
        projectile shot from a cannon with the velocity that the user enters. It
        can also solve for values (speed, angle, etc) to hit the target. It is
        the most complicated software that I have developed.
